# Cheat Sheets

Because useful information should generally be publicly available.

## 🕵️ Find and Search

I usually [search by file name](https://github.com/mritzmann/cheatsheets/find/master) only, as I know which files to search in.

## 👷‍♂️ Examples

[dnssec](dnssec.md), [awk](awk.md), [regex](regex.md), [btrfs](btrfs.md), [cron](cron.md), [openssl](openssl.md)
